# Java Pusher Client, a Pusher client developed for use with Java or Android
Blog: [Public Static Droid Main](http://publicstaticdroidmain.com/)

[Pusher] (http://www.pusherapp.com) is a Push Notification service that uses Websockets for relaying messages back and forth between clients.  This allows real time messaging between a diverse range of applications running on Web browsers, mobile devices and now Arduinos.  It is my hope that allowing devices to easily send information about themselves as well as respond to messages received from applications and other devices will result in some interesting applications.
